1.  Demo
  - Add color coding to stack overflow answers, based on the current answer score
  -- Show corgify popup 

-- Dog.ceo API where we fetched images of random corgis, so we have an almost endless supply of corgi pictures
-- Maybe in the future, can you can select the dog breed that you want

1. Communicating from the popup window of our extension, to the main window of stackoverflow   
    - Solved using message passing and chrome tabs api
    - bc popup has its own dom, cannot access main window


2. Using query selector to select elements with certain html attributes (ex: data-score), 
    not by id or class like usual
